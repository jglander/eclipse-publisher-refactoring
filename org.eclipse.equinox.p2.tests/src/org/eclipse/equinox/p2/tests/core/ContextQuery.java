/**
 * ContextQuery is the abstract superclass for Queries that require the entire
 * input to evaluate the results.  Queries must consider the group of elements before
 * processing the results. <P>
 * 
 * ContextQueries must also be transitive. That is, if run on a subset of the 
 * input, the order in which they are executed must not matter. If there is the 
 * need for a non-transitive query, please see:
 * https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=261403
 * <p>
 * Users of this query must call {@link #perform(Iterator)} to compute 
 * the results. <P>
 * This class may be subclassed by clients. Subclasses should specify the type
 * of object they support querying on. Subclasses are also encouraged to clearly
 * specify their match algorithm, and expose the parameters involved in the match
 * computation, to allow {@link IQueryable} implementations to optimize their
 * execution of the query. <P>
